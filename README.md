## Description
The motive behind this application was to help solve a managing problem as an all in one platform to help add departments, add chores, add users, assign managers, and more. While working on this project there was a lot of things I learned along the way. Some being the following: 
* The importance of your seeds. This was very crucial in linking all the information to the departments. Knowing how to reference the seeds information on the front end was also a challenge on the handlebars part. .  
* How to properly test routes. I was in charge of making sure the routes worked with insomnia and the department handlebars. The good thing I didnt know that would help was how to read the information that was being sent as a request on insomnia would help get an idea of how to sort the handlebar in order to make sure the proper information would be called back.
